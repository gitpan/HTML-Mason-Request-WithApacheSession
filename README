HTML::Mason::Request::WithApacheSession
=======================================

This module takes advantage of the new flexibility in Mason 1.09_01
and newer to integrate an Apache::Session session directly into
Mason's Request object.

This module is very alpha at this point, considering that it only
works with a beta release of Mason!

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then in your httpd.conf file add:

   PerlSetVar  MasonRequestClass       HTML::Mason::Request::WithApacheSession
   PerlSetVar  MasonSessionClass       Apache::Session::File
   PerlSetVar  MasonSessionDataSource  dbi:mysql:somedb

DEPENDENCIES

You must have Mason 1.09_01 or newer installed for this module to work
at all.

BUGS

There is a bug in the most recent Mason beta, 1.09_02, that makes it
impossible to configure this module via the Apache configuration file.
Mason will complain about invalid parameters.  If you really want to
live on the bleading edge, feel free to install the CVS version of
Mason, which includes a fix for this bug.
